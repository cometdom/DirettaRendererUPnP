# Changelog

## [1.2.1] - 2026-01-06

### 🎵 DSD Format Enhancement Thanks to @SwissMontainsBear
**Improved DSD File Detection**
- **Smart DSF vs DFF detection**: Automatic detection of DSD source format based on file extension (`.dsf` or `.dff`)
- **Bit order handling**: Proper bit reversal flag (`m_needDsdBitReversal`) to handle LSB-first (DSF) vs MSB-first (DFF) formats
- **Format propagation**: DSD source format information flows from AudioEngine to DirettaRenderer for accurate playback configuration

**Technical Implementation:**
- `TrackInfo::DSDSourceFormat` enum to track DSF vs DFF files
- File extension parsing in AudioEngine to detect format type
- Fallback to codec string parsing if file detection fails
- Integration with DirettaOutput for correct bit order processing

### 🔧 Seeking Improvements

**DSD Raw Seek Enhancement**
- **File repositioning for DSD**: Precise seeking in raw DSD streams using byte-level positioning
- **Accurate calculation**: Bit-accurate positioning based on sample rate and channel count
- **Better logging**: Enhanced debug output showing target bytes, bits, and format information

**Benefits:**
- More accurate seek operations in DSD files
- Proper file pointer management during playback
- Improved user experience when scrubbing through DSD tracks

## [1.2.0] - 2025-12-27

### 🎵 Major Features

#### Gapless Pro (SDK Native)
- **Seamless track transitions** using Diretta SDK native gapless methods
- Implemented `writeStreamStart()`, `addStream()`, and `checkStreamStart()` for zero-gap playback
- Pre-buffering of next track (1 second) for instant transitions
- Support for format changes with minimal interruption (~50-200ms for DAC resync)
- Fully automatic - works with any UPnP control point supporting `SetNextAVTransportURI`
- Enable/disable via `--no-gapless` command-line option

**User Experience:**
- Live albums play without interruption
- Conceptual albums (Pink Floyd, etc.) maintain artistic flow
- DJ mixes and crossfades preserved
- Perfect for audiophile listening sessions

### 🛡️ Stability Improvements

#### Critical Format Change Fixes
- **Buffer draining** before format changes to prevent pink noise and crashes
- **Double close protection** prevents crashes from concurrent close() calls
- **Anti-deadlock callback system** eliminates 5-second timeouts during format transitions
- **Exception handling** in SyncBuffer disconnect operations

**Impact:** Estimated 70-90% reduction in format change related crashes

#### Network Optimization
- **Adaptive network configuration** based on audio format:
  - **DSD**: VarMax mode for maximum throughput
  - **Hi-Res (≥192kHz or ≥88.2kHz/24bit)**: Adaptive variable timing
  - **Standard (44.1/48kHz)**: Fixed timing for stability
- Automatic optimization on format changes
- Better performance for high-resolution audio streams

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

#### AudioEngine
- Optimized `prepareNextTrackForGapless()` to reuse pre-loaded decoder
- Eliminates redundant file opens and I/O operations
- Better CPU and memory efficiency during gapless transitions

#### DirettaOutput
- New `isBufferEmpty()` method for clean buffer management
- New `optimizeNetworkConfig()` for format-specific network tuning
- Enhanced `close()` with early state marking to prevent re-entrance
- Try-catch protection around SDK disconnect operations

#### DirettaRenderer
- CallbackGuard supports manual early release
- Callback flag released before long operations to prevent deadlocks
- Explicit buffer draining with timeout in format change sequences

### 📊 Performance

- **Gapless transitions:** 0ms gap for same format, ~50-200ms for format changes
- **Format change stability:** +70-90% improvement
- **Network throughput:** Optimized per format (DSD/Hi-Res/Standard)
- **CPU usage:** Reduced redundant decoder operations

### 🎛️ Command Line

**New Options:**
- `--no-gapless`: Disable gapless playback (enabled by default)

**Existing Options (reminder):**
- `--buffer <seconds>`: Buffer size (default: 2.0, can use 0.5-1.0 for lower latency)
- `--thread-mode <value>`: Advanced Diretta SDK threading
- Network options: `--interface`, `--bind-ip` for multi-homed systems

### 📝 Configuration

**Default Settings (optimal for most users):**
```bash
Buffer: 2.0 seconds
Gapless: Enabled
Network: Auto-adaptive by format
```

**Low Latency Setup:**
```bash
./DirettaRendererUPnP --target 1 --buffer 0.5
# ~1.5s total latency with gapless still working perfectly
```

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed race condition in `prepareNextTrackForGapless()`
- Fixed potential deadlock during format changes
- Fixed double close() causing crashes
- Fixed pink noise on format changes due to improper buffer handling
- Fixed memory leak in error paths (proper cleanup with `.reset()`)

### 🔍 Debugging

**Enhanced Logging:**
- Gapless preparation logs: "♻️ Reusing pre-loaded decoder"
- Network config logs: "Mode: VarMax/Var/Fix" based on format
- Buffer draining logs: "Buffer drained in Xms"
- Format change sequence logs with step-by-step progress

**Verbose Mode:**
```bash
sudo ./DirettaRendererUPnP --target 1 --verbose
# Shows detailed gapless, network, and buffer operations
```

### 📚 Documentation

- Updated installation guide
- Added gapless troubleshooting section
- Network optimization explained
- Buffer sizing recommendations

### ⚙️ Compatibility

- **Backward Compatible:** All v1.1.x features preserved
- **Control Points Tested:**
  - ✅ Roon (excellent gapless support)
  - ✅ BubbleUPnP (good support)
  - ✅ mConnect (basic support)
  - ⚠️ JPlay iOS (limited - no SetNextURI support)

### 🎯 Known Limitations

- Format changes require DAC resynchronization (~50-200ms gap) - hardware limitation
- Control points must support `SetNextAVTransportURI` for gapless
- Some control points (JPlay iOS) have limited gapless capabilities

### 🔄 Migration from v1.1.1

**No configuration changes needed!** Simply update binaries.

**Recommendations:**
1. Test with `--buffer 1.0` for lower latency (gapless still works)
2. Enable verbose mode to see gapless in action: `--verbose`
3. For format-heavy playlists, ensure stable network (Ethernet recommended)
